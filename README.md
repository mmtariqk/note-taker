## App Description

This note taker application permits a user to save notes with a title and plain text. This application is created in EXPRESS JS.

So you need to Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. To use the application on your machine locally, run `node server.js` in your CLI, and then open `http://localhost:2020` in your favorite browser. Besides, see the server is running on designated port.
